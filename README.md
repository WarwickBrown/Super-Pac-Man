Software Development II - Course Project

# Super Pac-Man - First Submission

## Overview
This project is a keyboard-driven version of the classic game Super Pac-Man, developed as part of the Software Development II course at the University of the Witwatersrand. The game features basic functionality where Pac-Man can move around in a simple maze using the ARROW KEYS.

## Controls
- **ARROW KEYS**: Move Pac-Man
- **ENTER**: Start the game
- **ESC**: Exit the game

## Current Features
- **Splash Screen**: Upon starting the game, a splash screen is displayed, welcoming the player and providing game instructions. The splash screen has a black background and a Pac-Man-esque theme, including appropriately colored text.
- **Animated Pac-Man**: Pac-Man is depicted with a graphic image that animates his movement, giving the appearance of his iconic chomping motion.
- **Maze Movement**: Pac-Man can be moved within a simple maze.
- **Collision Detection**: Pac-Man's movement is restricted by the maze walls using basic collision detection, preventing him from passing through walls.
- **Testing**: Basic movement tests have been implemented using the `doctest` framework.

## Known Issues
- The current maze is a simple layout, and the ghosts have not yet been implemented.
